      "summary": "Dark humanoid silhouettes typically observed in peripheral vision, often associated with feelings of dread and frequently reported during sleep paralysis episodes. A widely reported modern phenomenon particularly prevalent in online paranormal communities.",
      "full": "Shadow People are dark, featureless humanoid silhouettes reported worldwide, particularly since the 1990s with the rise of internet-based paranormal discussion. Witnesses describe these entities as distinctly darker than surrounding shadows, often appearing solid black or semi-transparent, typically 6-8 feet tall, and lacking facial features or details. The phenomenon is strongly associated with peripheral vision sightings, bedroom encounters during sleep or near-sleep states, and an overwhelming sense of dread or malevolence. The 'Hat Man' variant—a shadow figure wearing a wide-brimmed hat or fedora—is reported with striking consistency across cultures and geography. While paranormal explanations range from ghosts to interdimensional beings, scientific research points to sleep paralysis, hypnagogia, and neurological factors as probable explanations for many experiences."
