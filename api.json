      "full": "Shadow People are dark humanoid silhouettes typically observed in peripheral vision, often associated with feelings of dread and frequently reported during sleep paralysis episodes. They are described as distinctly darker than surrounding shadows, appearing as solid black or semi-transparent figures, typically 6-8 feet tall, and completely lacking facial features or surface details. This phenomenon gained widespread attention in the 1990s with the rise of internet-based paranormal discussion, becoming one of the most reported experiences in online paranormal communities. The \\\"Hat Man\\\" variant—a shadow figure wearing a distinctive wide-brimmed hat or fedora—is reported with remarkable consistency across different cultures and geographic locations. While paranormal explanations range from ghosts and demons to interdimensional beings, scientific research increasingly points to sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, peripheral vision artifacts, and neurological factors as the most likely explanations for the majority of shadow people experiences."
